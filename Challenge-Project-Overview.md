## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use SAS datasets and legacy SAS programs and large language model (LLM)-based agentic AI techniques to translate SAS code into Python, validate outputs, and generate documentation of data processing workflows. This will help our company address the challenge of efficiently migrating legacy SAS systems to modern, scalable Python-based data pipelines while reducing manual effort and errors.

This project was proposed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program to explore how Agentic AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) can be used to modernize legacy analytics workflows.

The objective is to build a system that automates the migration of SAS data processing pipelines to Python. The solution will translate SAS programs into Python, validate that the translated code produces equivalent results, identify discrepancies, and generate documentation describing the underlying data processing logic. The project will be evaluated using a real-world SAS pipeline consisting of four interdependent programs, including macro-based processing and analytical algorithms.

Many organizations continue to rely on SAS softwares which are costly. Migrating these systems to Python often requires significant manual effort for code translation, testing, validation, and documentation. This project explores how Agentic AI can help automate portions of that workflow while maintaining accuracy and transparency.

A successful solution could provide a reusable framework for migrating legacy SAS workflows, reducing modernization effort, preserving valuable business knowledge, and helping organizations transition to more accessible and scalable Python-based analytics platforms.

### Success Criteria
Success for this project will be measured through a combination of accuracy, completeness, and usability of the end-to-end migration system. A successful project will deliver a functional, end-to-end prototype that can reliably migrate a SAS data pipeline to Python, validate the results, and clearly explain the transformation process.

### Stretch Goals
Although the core task is already complex due to macros and algorithmic logic in the pipeline. Additional work could include improving validation, enhancing documentation, building a simple demo interface, or applying the system to more complex SAS programs if time permits.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month      | Milestone                 | Key Activities                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **September** | Data Exploration & Setup        | Understand SAS code structures (DATA step, PROC SQL), explore sample datasets, and build initial SAS-to-Python translation prototypes. Set up the environment for executing Python scripts and loading SAS data.       |
| **October**   | Core System Development         | Develop the main translation module, implement execution pipelines, and build validation logic (row counts, column checks, aggregates). Generate basic comparison outputs between SAS and Python results.      |
| **November**  | End-to-End Pipeline Migration  | Apply the system to a real SAS pipeline consisting of four dependent programs. The system should successfully translate, execute, validate, and document the pipeline from start to finish using the provided input dataset. Finalize outputs and prepare a demonstration of the full migration workflow.s          |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.

## 📊 Dataset

**Name and Source:** SAS datasets and legacy programs from [https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/software](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/software)  
**Format:** SAS  
**Size:** under 1gb  
**Location:** Data is accessible at the source link provided.

### Key Details
- Numerical and text data stored in SAS format, including legacy programs and datasets. 
- The public data source is available at: https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/public-reporting/overall-ratings/software
- No known limitations or preprocessing needed at this time.
  
### Data Exploration :
  
Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating Statistical Analysis System SAS package is used to produce the 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ (CMS’s) Overall Hospital Quality Star Rating 
published to Care Compare on Medicare.gov This SAS Pack comprises three main SAS programs and 
one macro file to provide a specified quarter’s group scores, summary scores, and 
star ratings using a simple average of measure scores into group scores, 
a weighted average of group scores into a summary score, and k-means clustering.

The SAS programs and log files can be read by any text reader. SAS datasets can only be opened in SAS environment, or 
can be imported in python using python packages. Since it won't be possible to run the SAS programs outside of SAS 
environment, we have provided all the input and output SAS data files in CSV format along with the SAS log file and HTML
with print out from SAS procedures.
