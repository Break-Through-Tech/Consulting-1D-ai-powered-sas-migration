| Check   | Status | Notes                                                                   |
|---------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python Compatibility | 🟢 | The tech stack includes Python for the migration and validation, making it compatible for student use. |
| Data Readiness | 🟢  | Data is small, under 1GB, making it manageable for students without extensive cleaning. |
| Resource Check | 🟢  | Only uses free-tier tools like Google Colab, accessible for all students. |

**Student Fit Score:** 7/10  
**Technical Depth Score:** 8/10  
**Overall Recommendation:** REVISE

**Advisor Feedback Draft:**
The project presents a strong integration of practical industry challenges with technical skills applicable in real-world scenarios. However, consider simplifying aspects of the LLM integration to ensure students can effectively learn and complete the project within the timeframe. Additionally, reinforce SAS training for students less familiar with it before starting these integrations. Ensure students feel supported on both legacy understanding and Python migration techniques.

## 🎯 The Challenge

### Project Summary
In this project, you will use SAS datasets and legacy SAS programs and large language model (LLM)-based agentic AI techniques to translate SAS code into Python, validate outputs, and generate documentation of data processing workflows. This will help our company address the challenge of efficiently migrating legacy SAS systems to modern, scalable Python-based data pipelines while reducing manual effort and errors.

### Success Criteria
Success for this project will be measured through a combination of accuracy, completeness, and usability of the end-to-end migration system. A successful project will deliver a functional, end-to-end prototype that can reliably migrate a SAS data pipeline to Python, validate the results, and clearly explain the transformation process.

### Stretch Goals
Although the core task is already complex due to macros and algorithmic logic in the pipeline. Additional work could include improving validation, enhancing documentation, building a simple demo interface, or applying the system to more complex SAS programs if time permits.

### Project Milestones

Use these milestones to guide your work. Your team will create a **GitHub Projects board** to track tasks within each milestone.

| Month      | Milestone                 | Key Activities                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **September** | Data Exploration & Setup        | Understand SAS code structures (DATA step, PROC SQL), explore sample datasets, and build initial SAS-to-Python translation prototypes. Set up the environment for executing Python scripts and loading SAS data.       |
| **October**   | Core System Development         | Develop the main translation module, implement execution pipelines, and build validation logic (row counts, column checks, aggregates). Generate basic comparison outputs between SAS and Python results.      |
| **November**  | End-to-End Pipeline Migration  | Apply the system to a real SAS pipeline consisting of four dependent programs. The system should successfully translate, execute, validate, and document the pipeline from start to finish using the provided input dataset. Finalize outputs and prepare a demonstration of the full migration workflow.s          |

> **Note for the team:** Please create a GitHub Projects board in this repository to break these milestones into weekly tasks. Go to the **Projects** tab → **New project** → Choose **Board** → Add columns for each month.
